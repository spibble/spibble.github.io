        <h2 id="intro">intro</h2>

        <p>
            you can call me <b>spibble</b> or <b>dragn</b> or <b>Miles</b>; don't really care which! 
            i am currently a student at UC San Diego studying cognitive science and math-cs. i
            i actually didn't like programming and stuff all that much until towards the
            end of my second year, so now i'm trying to make up for lost time :P
        </p>

        <p>
            if you would like to get in contact with me, i use <b>Discord</b> (@.spibble) and no other
            social media! you can also send me <a href="mailto:spider.nybble@gmail.com">an email</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="programming">programming interests</h2>

        <p>
            i'm interested in a lot of different things programming-wise but currently my
            biggest interests are <b>embedded systems</b> and <b>robotics</b>! i took an embedded class in
            the winter quarter of my second year and i really really liked it, and i just think
            there are so many cool things you can do with a microcontroller that i actually want
            to go out and do them! i owe it to that class (CSE 190 with Aaron Shalev/Schulman)
            for giving me something to actually be really interested in. then, the following quarter,
            i participated in a competition where my team built a robotic arm, and i did all the firmware 
            programming. we didn't win but it was really fun and i'm happy i decided to do it because that 
            was my first time participating in any sort of competition. ultimately i am still figuring
            things out, but these last two quarters (WI25, SP25) have been such a big period of growth
            for me :) (and probably more than the previous four combined)
        </p>

        <p>
            i also occasionally do some Python scripting from time to time, and have been dabbling
            in web development (mostly HTML and CSS and plain JS for now). i would like to learn TS
            at some point though! in general, i think knowing many different types of programming
            languages/use cases/etc. is good for being a more versatile developer, even if there are
            some times i clearly enjoy doing much more than others :P
        </p>

        <h2 id="hobbies">other interests (a.k.a. hobbies)</h2>

        <p>
            outside of school, i'd say my biggest hobby is probably arcading and <b>playing rhythm games</b>!
            i actually haven't gone to the arcade much lately, but i do love a good grind session, and 
            by grind i just mean go around and play all the games because i'm not really that good at
            any of them. my favorite (by far) is <b>Taiko no Tatsujin</b>; i have a drum controller and everything,
            which is a little embarassing to admit because i'm not actually that good at the game. i'm around
            6-7 dan on keyboard, and 1-2 dan on drum (lol). my next favorites after that are probably <b>pop'n</b>
            and <b>sdvx</b>, which are the ones i really wanna play more of off the top of my head. not to say the
            other games aren't fun too, i just don't wanna sit here all day listing them
        </p>

        <p>
            another big hobby of mine is music! i played quite a few instruments growing up and, although
            i am not actively participating in anything right now, i was in band all of high school and
            participated in my school's wind ensemble for 4 quarters, as well as a couple of other musical
            extracurriculars. currently i am trying to <b>relearn how to play piano</b> after a long time of never
            touching one, and i also want to <b>learn how to produce electronic music</b> too! i am a huge fan of
            rhythm game music (of course)&mdash;some of my favorite artists currently are <b>linear ring, Cansol,
            AAAA, Umeboshi Chazuke,</b> and <b>GrivR</b> (the only song i know of theirs is Hopscotch, but it's so good 
            that i am willing to) consider them a favorite. another favorite of mine outside of the rhythm
            game bubble is azali. i wanna learn how to make music like all of these people someday!
        </p>

        <p>
            i am also a furry, which i would consider to be a hobby. i have a lot of characters, but a few
            main ones (i'm on and off between calling them sonas); if you want to see them, you can find
            them on <a href="https://toyhou.se/spibble">toyhou.se</a>. i really want to learn how to draw
            some day so that i can draw them myself instead of always having to rely on my artist friends/
            commissions to see them doing silly things!
        </p>

        <p>
            i do also need a few more hobbies, so hopefully this upcoming summer i'll have some free time
            to explore new things!
        </p>


        <h2 id="projects">projects</h2>

        <h3>future project ideas:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>e-ink fursona badge</b>: 
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/5-65inch-Display-Module-Compatible-Raspberry/dp/B08J7GGRYF">these</a>
                multi color e-ink displays are really fascinating, and i feel like they would be the perfect 
                display type to use for something like a fursona badge! the goal of this would be to just make 
                a little programmable thing so i can switch between a few different characters/designs, and if 
                i really want to go overboard, i could make a phone app or something for live uploading to it. 
                potentially some other features too!
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>electronic fursuit head</b>: probably a very long term project. a fursuit head with tons of 
                electronics in it based on one of my characters, 
                <a href="https://toyhou.se/16202053.tbn">Spidr</a>!
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>personal website</b>: this website is a future project, funnily enough. i really want to make a 
                really cool, highly styled website using something like Astro and tons of CSS, but i decided 
                just to get a shitty pure HTML version out there just because i can. but yeah, there is a lot 
                more plannned for this website in the future.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>currently in progress:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b><a href="https://fgsa-at-ucsd.netlify.app">CCE 3 project website</a></b>: for one of my classes 
                i got the opportunity to make a website, and the theme of the class was community engagement, 
                so i figured why not make a website for a school club that aims to build community? 
                i'm finishing up the first version of the website right now, and i've learned a lot about making
                websites from this project (the last one i made was three years ago and basically raw HTML and CSS). 
                on my more fully-featured personal website, i'd like to have a space to write blog posts and this 
                will probably be the subject of the first one!
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>projects i've completed:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b><a href="https://github.com/spibble/robothon-ctrl-arm-del">robotic arm</a></b>: this arm is powered by 
                an esp-32 and has 6 degrees of freedom using some SG90 and MG996R servo motors. this was a super fun 
                project because it was my second time using a microcontroller, my first time using a breadboard, 
                wires, and other electronic components for a real project, and i also got to hone some of my existing 
                skills! as a stretch i also got a simple web interface working using a websocket connection, which was 
                also new to me! unfortunately i didn't get as much experience with IK or lower-level programming as 
                i wanted to, but since i kept the arm...
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>lost device tracker</b>: this was my CSE 190 project! it's an stm32 dev board project that monitors 
                accelerometer readings and can activate "lost mode" after the device hasn't moved for a while, 
                in which it can connect to a phone and relay information like how much time has passed. this was 
                my very first embedded project, my first time working with an MCU, etc. and it was really fun! 
                i feel like i learned a lot of the basics like embedded C concepts, ISRs, GPIO, and I2C. it was 
                also really fun optimizing power; we were able to get it down to around 80 uA, which was 
                unfortunately not enough to win (though we did get second).
            </li>
                <b><a href="https://github.com/spibble/yaurls">url shortener</a></b>: to be honest, i'm not super proud 
                of this one, but it is a thing that i made so it goes in here! it's a url shortener and it does 
                exactly that; you plug in a url, get a shortened one, plug in the short url, and it redirects you 
                to the correct page. this was an opportunity to learn basic backend dev using python/fastapi/sqlite,
                though i would definitely be interested in re-making this project again in the future to make it 
                more of an actual project rather than something i just shat out super quickly lol
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>note: these lists are not exhaustive; i have just put here what i can remember but i plan to add more!</p>

        <h2 id="experience">experience</h2>
        
        <h3>software engineering intern @ [redacted]</h3>

        <p>
            i'm gonna redact the name just because i can (it still appears other places, so you can find it if you want).
            i interned here from <b>june 2024</b> to <b>august 2024</b>; i did some basic frontend/backend dev stuff and bug fixing
            using react and .NET. i also had the opportunity to do some cool things, such as test automation using
            Playwright and an independent AI project, although those were unfortunately cut short due to the internship
            timeline and also poor management (not on the fault of my bosses, they were cool; just unlucky circumstances).
            i was not interested in interning there for another summer, but i think it was still a good opportunity
            and i'm glad i pushed myself to do it!
        </p>

        <h3>Cognitive Science instructional assistant @ UCSD</h3>

        <p>
            this was a one-quarter stint lasting from <b>march 2025</b> to <b>june 2025</b> (which means, at the time i'm
            currently writing this, it's my current job). i'm an IA for COGS 108 (Python data science)! this involved
            teaching students Python programming, data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn, data
            collection (web scraping), cleaning, and analysis, and applications of machine learning algorithms. i also
            got to work with python scripting for things like Canvas LMS and Github, which was super fun! it was fun to
            see things from the other end for this class in particular (since it's so large) and apply my teaching skills
            to yet another position. however i did not get paid so 0/10 (joking, but only kinda)
        </p>
        <h3>CSE department tutor @ UCSD</h3>

        <p>
            i tutored for CSE 29 (software tools and systems programming) from <b>september 2024</b> to
            <b>december 2025</b> and will be tutoring for it again in the summer <b>june to july 2025</b>! this is definitely
            my favorite teaching position i've had so far, as C is such a fun programming language and i love teaching the
            basics to people. it's also a really versatile class that also teaches students CLI tools and things like
            Github which they will definitely use, even if they don't end up using C or any of the baby OS concepts that
            are taught in that class. and unlike IA-ing i did get paid so it gets a 10/10 from me!
        </p>

        <h3>OASIS math tutor & facilitator @ UCSD</h3>

        <p>
            this was my longest stint of employment by far, as i was a math tutor from <b>october 2023</b> to
            <b>june 2024</b>! i worked for the Office of Academic Support and Instructional Services which is basically just a
            math, science, and writing tutoring center on campus. it was really fun because it was as much a teaching position
            as it was a social work position, as an important part of the job was fostering a safe space and community building
            for students and offering them advice for school, picking classes, etc. a lot of these students were first-gen
            (as am i) and it was a great opportunity to really lean into that identity and impact people in ways that extend
            far beyond their math class homework. although i prefer tutoring for the CSE department more (mostly just because
            they pay more lol) this was a really unique opportunity and i am glad i did it!
        </p>

        <h2 id="thoughts">thoughts</h2>

        <p>
            on my actual website i'm planning to have a page for blog posts and a 
            <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>, but for now i will have a list of my raw unfiltered thoughts, 
            subject to change whenever i remember to change it.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>5/31/25, 8:14pm</b>: follow-up to my previous thought. i'm torn between making my website super stylized
                and super small with minimal CSS and no JS. maybe i can make separate versions for both? right now what i
                am thinking is a website that's perfectly functional with no JS, and then also lots of styles and two
                different "themes" for personal and professional so that i can have the fun personal theme on by default but
                link to the professional theme when putting it on my resume or in a job application or something. so far,
                it doesn't sound like that bad of an idea...
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>5/30/25, 1:52pm</b>: one thing that i thought about before making this site, and thinking about right now,
                and will likely continue to think about is how i want to manage having both personal and professional content
                on here. deep down, i really want this site to be silly and fun and a place for me to share my hobbies, but
                i can't deny that not having a similar space for all of my professional achievements would be nice. right now
                since it's so simple the personal and the professional are just mushed together without much thought, but i
                want to explore that in future versions of this website. keeping it like that? having different styles for
                personal and professional? having different sites, even? is everything easily splittable into personal and
                professional categories, or do things blend together and overlap? i think i'm thinking too much right now.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>5/29/25, 11:59pm</b>: i just finished writing this whole thing. i wasn't planning to start working on a personal 
                website until the summer, but i was watching a video about how to make nice clickable tabs within a page 
                using CSS and JavaScript for the CCE 3 website project. the guy in the video kept talking about "progressive 
                enhancement," which is 1) definitely something i should practice when making my personal website and 2) not 
                something i practiced with the CCE 3 website which i probably should have. so, i'm practicing it now by
                making this really shitty website which will hopefully serve as a base for me to figure out the structure 
                and improve upon!
