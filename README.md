My personal website. More to come soon!

## Tech I'd like to use

| Tech     | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| Astro    | Framework/Components    |
| Tailwind | Styling     |
| MDX    | Writing/Syntax    |
| Netlify/Vercel | Hosting |

## Ideas
- Fun section and professional section
  - Is this really necessary though?
    - (Con) People can make their websites fun while also including their personal information, so it's more complicated than it needs to be. How will I sync information between the two?
    - (Pro) I have to make 2 different layouts/styles so it would be good to get practice and probably make this a much cooler project.
   
- One-pager vs. many pages
  - One page: easy to maintain, concise, no problem finding content to fill up the page. Harder to organize and maybe a little more limiting.
  - Many pages: much easier to organize stuff, different pages for different things. Lots more to do and there might be some overlap between fun and professional stuff.
    - Fun:          Home, Art/Characters, Projects, Blog, Now
    - Professional: Home, Projects, Resume, Now

- Now that I'm thinking about it, a good start to a personal blog would be to document the process of making this website..
