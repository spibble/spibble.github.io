        <h2 id="intro">hi</h2>

        <p>
            you can call me <b>spibble</b> or <b>dragn</b> or <b>Miles</b>; i don't really care which! i'm a student at UCSD studying the sciences of cognitive and computer. (formerly also math, but it was too smart for me)
        </p>

		<h2 id="contact">where to find me</h2>

		<p>
			if you would like to get in contact with me, i use <b>Discord</b> (@spibblest) as my primary messenger and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/spibble.site"><b>Bluesky</b></a> as my primary social media. I do not use anything else regularly! so, message me on those places, or risk shouting into the void.
		</p>

		<p>
		some other places i have a public presence on include <a href="https://www.github.com/spibble"><b>Github</b></a> for any public programming i do for school, work, or personal reasons; and <a href="https://toyhou.se/spibble"><b>Toyhouse</b></a> for character and art storage. feel free to browse, but i will most likely not be very responsive to attempts to message or contact me on those places.
		</p>
		<p>
		if you're cool, you can also <a href="mailto:spibblest@gmail.com">send me an email</a>!
		</p>


		<h2 id="now">what i'm up to rn</h2>

		<p>
			the date is <b>2/1/2026</b> (happy February!). in school, it is currently the quarter WI26 and i am taking the following classes:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>COGS 189</b>: Brain Computer Interfaces</li>
			<li><b>CSE 107</b>: Cryptography</li>
			<li><b>CSE 122</b>: Wireless Networking</li>
			<li><b>CSE 160</b>: Parallel Programming</li>
			<li><b>MUS 20</b>: Exploring the Musical Mind</li>
			<li><b>MUS 171</b>: Computer Music I</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			it's a pretty challenging but intellectually stimulating quarter! yes, i'm taking quite a few classes, partially because i'm trying to meet schedules when certain classes are offered in the year and partially because i'm unemployed this quarter ( :( ).
		</p>

		<p>
			interestingly, this schedule sort of demonstrates a shift in my school focus from math-y computer science to more systems level stuff and a different interest of mine, music! i actually enjoy the music classes the most of all my classes this quarter, which makes me think about declaring a music minor.
		</p>

		<p>
			in general, i think computer-generated (through real programming and creativity, NOT large AI model-generated) art is actually really awesome and i'd love to learn more about it! in my computer music class, we are learning how to synthesize music using <b>PureData</b>, and i am really looking forward to the final project. i also recently went to Further Confusion 2026, and there i attended a panel about the demoscene, which i thought was very cool. i'm not sure if i'd ever have the technical skill and willpower for that sort of thing, but it's a subculture that i had never heard of before but now have massive respect for.
		</p>

		<p>
			outside of school, i am currently chilling! i honestly don't have that much time once all of my school-related things (coursework, extracurriculars, etc.) are done with, so i am not currently working on any large projects on my own. i have ideas that will hopefully lead to actions soon, but no promises (if i do actually start anything, rest assured it will appear on Github). i have an internship this summer which i secured back in December, which i am EXTREMELY grateful for, because if i also had to apply for jobs with my curent schedule i think i would actually lose it!! if you are currently applying for internships and/or jobs i wish you the best of luck, it's really tough out there currently :(
