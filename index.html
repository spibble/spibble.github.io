        <h2 id="intro">intro</h2>

        <p>
            you can call me spibble or dragn or miles; don't really care which! 
            i am currently a student at UC San Diego studying cognitive science and math-cs. i
            i actually didn't like programming and stuff all that much until towards the
            end of my second year, so now i'm trying to make up for lost time :P
        </p>

        <h2 id="programming">programming interests</h2>

        <p>
            i'm interested in a lot of different things programming-wise but currently my
            biggest interests are embedded systems and robotics! i took an embedded class in
            the winter quarter of my second year and i really really liked it, and i just think
            there are so many cool things you can do with a microcontroller that i actually want
            to go out and do them! i owe it to that class (CSE 190 with Aaron Shalev/Schulman)
            for giving me something to actually be really interested in. then, the following quarter,
            i participated in a competition (Triton Droids' Robothon 2.0) where my team built a 
            robotic arm, and i did all the firmware programming. we didn't win but it was really fun
            and i'm happy i decided to do it because that was my first time participating in any sort
            of competition. these last two quarters (WI25, SP25) have been such a big period of growth
            for me :)
        </p>

        <h2 id="hobbies">other interests (a.k.a. hobbies)</h2>

        <p>
            outside of school, i'd say my biggest hobby is probably arcading and playing rhythm games!
            i actually haven't gone to the arcade much lately, but i do love a good grind session, and 
            by grind i just mean go around and play all the games because i'm not really that good at
            any of them. my favorite (by far) is Taiko no Tatsujin; i have a drum controller and everything,
            which is a little embarassing to admit because i'm not actually that good at the game. i'm around
            6-7 dan on keyboard, and 1-2 dan on drum (lol). my next favorites after that are probably pop'n
            and sdvx, which are the ones i really wanna play more of off the top of my head. not to say the
            other games aren't fun too, i just don't wanna sit here all day listing them
        </p>

        <p>
            another big hobby of mine is music! i played quite a few instruments growing up and, although
            i am not actively participating in anything right now, i was in band all of high school and
            participated in my school's wind ensemble for 4 quarters, as well as a couple of other musical
            extracurriculars. currently i am trying to relearn how to play piano after a long time of never
            touching one, and i also want to learn how to produce electronic music too! i am a huge fan of
            rhythm game music (of course)&mdash;some of my favorite artists currently are linear ring, Cansol,
            AAAA, Umeboshi Chazuke, and GrivR (the only song i know of theirs is Hopscotch, but it's so good 
            that i am willing to) consider them a favorite. another favorite of mine outside of the rhythm
            game bubble is azali. i wanna learn how to make music like all of these people someday!
        </p>

        <p>
            i am also a furry, which i would consider to be a hobby. i have a lot of characters, but a few
            main ones (i'm on and off between calling them sonas); if you want to see them, you can find
            them on <a href="https://toyhou.se/spibble">toyhou.se</a>. i really want to learn how to draw
            some day so that i can draw them myself instead of always having to rely on my artist friends/
            commissions to see them doing silly things!
        </p>

        <p>
            i do also need a few more hobbies, so hopefully this upcoming summer i'll have some free time
            to explore new things!
        </p>


        <h2 id="projects">projects</h2>

        <h3>future project ideas:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                e-ink fursona badge: 
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/5-65inch-Display-Module-Compatible-Raspberry/dp/B08J7GGRYF">these</a>
                multi color e-ink displays are really fascinating, and i feel like they would be the perfect 
                display type to use for something like a fursona badge! the goal of this would be to just make 
                a little programmable thing so i can switch between a few different characters/designs, and if 
                i really want to go overboard, i could make a phone app or something for live uploading to it. 
                potentially some other features too!
            </li>
            <li>
                electronic fursuit head: probably a very long term project. a fursuit head with tons of 
                electronics in it based on one of my characters, 
                <a href="https://toyhou.se/16202053.tbn">Spidr</a>!
            </li>
            <li>
                personal website: this website is a future project, funnily enough. i really want to make a 
                really cool, highly styled website using something like astro and tons of css, but i decided 
                just to get a shitty pure html version out there just because i can. but yeah, there is a lot 
                more plannned for this website in the future.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>currently in progress:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://fgsa-at-ucsd.netlify.app">CCE 3 project website</a>: for one of my classes 
                i got the opportunity to make a website, and the theme of the class was community engagement, 
                so i figured why not make a website for a school club that aims to build community? 
                i'm finishing up the first version of the website right now, and i've learned a lot about making
                websites from this project (the last one i made was three years ago and basically raw HTML and CSS). 
                on my more fully-featured personal website, i'd like to have a space to write blog posts and this 
                will probably be the subject of the first one!
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>projects i've completed:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/spibble/robothon-ctrl-arm-del">robotic arm</a>: this arm is powered by 
                an esp-32 and has 6 degrees of freedom using some SG90 and MG996R servo motors. this was a super fun 
                project because it was my second time using a microcontroller, my first time using a breadboard, 
                wires, and other electronic components for a real project, and i also got to hone some of my existing 
                skills! as a stretch i also got a simple web interface working using a websocket connection, which was 
                also new to me! unfortunately i didn't get as much experience with IK or lower-level programming as 
                i wanted to, but since i kept the arm...
            </li>
            <li>
                lost device tracker: this was my CSE 190 project! it's an stm32 dev board project that monitors 
                accelerometer readings and can activate "lost mode" after the device hasn't moved for a while, 
                in which it can connect to a phone and relay information like how much time has passed. this was 
                my very first embedded project, my first time working with an MCU, etc. and it was really fun! 
                i feel like i learned a lot of the basics like embedded C concepts, ISRs, GPIO, and I2C. it was 
                also really fun optimizing power; we were able to get it down to around 80 uA, which was 
                unfortunately not enough to win (though we did get second).
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/spibble/yaurls">url shortener</a>: to be honest, i'm not super proud 
                of this one, but it is a thing that i made so it goes in here! it's a url shortener and it does 
                exactly that; you plug in a url, get a shortened one, plug in the short url, and it redirects you 
                to the correct page. this was an opportunity to learn basic backend dev using python/fastapi/sqlite,
                though i would definitely be interested in re-making this project again in the future to make it 
                more of an actual project rather than something i just shat out super quickly lol
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>note: these lists are not exhaustive; i have just put here what i can remember but i plan to add more!</p>

        <h2 id="thoughts">thoughts</h2>

        <p>
            on my actual website i'm planning to have a page for blog posts and a 
            <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>, but for now i will have a list of my raw unfiltered thoughts, 
            subject to change whenever i remember to change it.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                5/29/25, 11:59pm: i just finished writing this whole thing. i wasn't planning to start working on a personal 
                website until the summer, but i was watching a video about how to make nice clickable tabs within a page 
                using css and javascript for the CCE 3 website project. the guy in the video kept talking about "progressive 
                enhancement," which is 1) definitely something i should practice when making my personal website and 2) not 
                something i practiced with the CCE 3 website which i probably should have. so, i'm practicing it now by
                making this really shitty website which will hopefully serve as a base for me to figure out the structure 
                and improve upon!
